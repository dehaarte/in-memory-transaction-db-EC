Data Processing and Storage
The project implments a simple in memory key-value database with transaction support funcationality.

The database supports the following operations:
begin_transaction()
put(key, value)
get(key)
commit()
rollback()

1. Requirements
    - Python 3

2. Clone the repository
    1. Open a terminal
    2. Run the following command: https://github.com/dehaarte/in-memory-transaction-db-EC.git

3. To run the code
    1. Move into the project directory: cd in-memory-transaction-db-EC
    2. Run the test script: python 3 test.py

To answer the last question for this assignment:
Include a example test file or give more instructions to students on submitting their own test cases would make it easier to tell if the code actually works. The grading section could also be clearer, “4 points for working code” vague, and doesn’t explain what proper explaination to what is  complete or correct. Breaking that down into smaller parts, like correct function behavior, would make the expectation more specific and better for grading.
